    </head> <h3 class="center">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used.</h3>

    <p>Trello helped me to create a list of task that I required to complete for my web page being able to add and move tasks from start to finish and was helpful in keeping up to date with task at hand. Visual studio code has been a useful tool to help create my website from html, java script to creating css file to improve the look of my blog overall the tools I used to create my page where helpful sometimes baffling that was only down to inexperience of my knowledge on how to code.</p>

</head> <h3 class="center">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h3>

<P>Creating a blog without using a computer is impossible. I also found using GitHub is a great tool being able to grab your work to use on any computer and carry on working on the task, saving your work to the cloud. Being a pc user and using windows products I found using the MacBook’s a pain to use. When it came to using visual studio code it wasn’t hard to miss bit of code or enter the code wrong and can take a while to find a simple error in the code the more I did with with visual studio code the more confident trying new things.</P>

</head> <h3 class="center">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness.</h3>

<P>The strength in my site is that it works to a certain degree and can be seen on multiple devices but like many before me the inexperience shows. I’m my own worst critic and if I was to change anything about my blog it would be to change the lot and start fresh and have a better plan of attack 
        In planning, design and the general layout and make it more user friendly.
        
        Since it was my first attempt in creating a web page</P>

</head> <h3 class="center">2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h3>

<P>The improvement I would make would be to improve the quality of design. I would do more research into what I could implement/ add into my project </P>

</head> <h3 class="center">2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h3>

<P>I found it hard to get the grip with writing parts of the code and required help from my fellow students and even the design of my web page I enjoyed trying to put images into the tab bar and choosing the right image the best part my web page is that it works and all the links works as should and changed the colour of the boxes to highlight the white writing.</P>
