</head> <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h3>

   <p>Technology has important effects on business operations. 
    No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both tangible and 
    intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results 
    your customers demand. Technological infrastructure affects the culture, 
    efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the security
    of confidential information and trade advantages<p>

    
</head> <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h3>

    <P>we’re currently using Trello, Visual studio code, Github to complete the project using the Internet to find information to help complete the task at hand
        group discussions
    </P>

</head> <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. </h3>

<P>As the old adage goes, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Building a website without a plan is like constructing a building without blueprints. Things end up in the wrong place, features are overlooked, and the situation is ripe for miscommunication between website builder and client. Planning your website ahead of time will give it clear direction as well as prevent missed deadlines and backtracking.</P>

</head><h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h3>
<P>There are lots of reasons digital projects fail. Sometimes the project is ill-conceived. Sometimes a vendor doesn’t come through, or there’s not adequate buy-in or resources. Usually it’s a combination of various factors, working together to trump even the best-laid plans</P>

</head><h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</h3>

<P>In our new wired modern reality, software is no less Important than products & services in our everyday lives. Whether it’s a personal email program, chat software , collaboration software , or and ERP implementation to manage company processes- there’s no surviving without them!

    But we’re somewhat more used to buying products & services than software, which is a relatively recent phenomenon . In many ways selecting software is no different from selecting a product or service. Although intangible, software, also address a very real need, on which personal & professional success often depends. Naturally some of the same purchase factors apply - brand, service & maintenance cost.</P>

</head><h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h3>

<p>Ive used a few tools to help with my work from using Trello, Visual studio code, Github and Apple macBook pro. With trello helping me plan the work I need to get done in a timely manner, to using visual studio code to help with writing code for java script, html and cascade style sheets</p>

</head><h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful source of information and entertainment, but it’s important to realise that there are a number of restrictions on what you can and cannot do online.
    There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, including music and videos. Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times a media file can be copied or converted to another format. When you buy software, you will  normally receive a licence to use it. You do not own the software itself, nor do you have the right to copy it. Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
    Legal constraints on online behaviour include protection of children legislation which prohibits grooming and inappropriate behaviour towards minors. You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of “netiquette” which describes the recommended conduct of users in various online environments. Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or offline.
    You should always ensure that you observe the correct guidelines and procedures for safe use of the Internet. It is not sufficient to know about guidelines and procedures – you must apply these when you are online.</p>
