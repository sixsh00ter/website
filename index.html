<h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
<P class="center">I grew up with a interest in computers and it wasn’t until I left school I could actually learn anything about computers even if it was maintenance and repairing of desktop units and put them skills to use building personal computers for friends and family. While I was in full time employment. I’ve had a interest in creating an app but had no idea where to start then I heard about code nation and what they do and how to implement into a working website</P>
