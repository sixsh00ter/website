<h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
<P class="center">I grew up with a interest in computers mainly playing on them and it wasn’t until I left school I learned about building computers even if it was maintenance and repairing of desktop units and put them skills to use building personal computers for friends and family. While I was in full time employment in demolition. since hearing about the crypto world and other projects I’ve had a interest in creating an app but had some idea where to start but wasnt confident enough to start then I heard about code nation and what they do and how to implement into a working website and maybe apps</P>
