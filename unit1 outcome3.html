    <P>Computers and technology allow for faster processing of data, easier retrieval of information, and in some cases - automation can reduce or replace physical employees. When people perform tasks by hand, it can be time consuming and full of human errors. When technology is used for repetitive operations, mistakes are reduced or eliminated, and the time it takes to complete the task is greatly reduced.
            In addition to making processes quicker, technology also makes it easy to keep information up to date. Instead of searching through a room of file cabinets and trying to guess how information was stored in order to update a customer address, a few clicks of the mouse and can pull up a customer file from a database. What used to take several minutes to an hour can now be done instantly.</P>

     <P>Tracking and limit the time you spend on task if you can’t gauge time use tools like reduce time. Take regular breaks to help with concentration. Set self imposed deadline, quit multitasking as we tend to do to much, take advantage of your commute instead of facebooking, snap chatting use the time more productively minimise interruption. Work in 90 minute intervals research has found that people
            who work in intervals of no more than 90 minutes are more productive than those who work 90 minutes-plus. They also found that top performing subjects tend to work no more than 4.5 hours per day. Sounds good to me!
            If you feel the need to increase your productivity at work, resist the temptation of putting in longer hours or pack more into your already-full calendar. Instead, take a step back, and think about ways you can work smarter, not harder.</P>

        <P>o improve my productivity id start with planning the layout of the site/app I also found working along side others sat close by that we could help each other out on bits of code we was stuck at in our projects and using slack to help with writing code and send bits of code back and fourth between us. The things I would differently would be to plan better and ask for more help quicker as making little mistake can take a while to find when writing code even the littlest bit of wrong code can bring your page down.</P>

            </head> <h3 class="center"> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.<h3>
                <P>We could use a/b testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a method of comparing two version of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. We could also try users and see how they interact with the work. Mutation testing where we mutate (change) certain statements in the source code and check if the test cases are able to find errors in the code and we could try testing on multiple device ie phones, tablets, window base machines to apple mac to see how are code act upon these different devices. We can also do functionality test to make sure everything is working as it should</P>
